Bathrooms @ Brown improves accessibility by providing detailed information about public bathrooms across campus; users can filter categories like gender-neutral, single-occupancy, or wheelchair accessible bathrooms. For example, someone might specifically seek out a nearby single-occupancy bathroom because of religious reasons, because they're a parent with a child, etc.
